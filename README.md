# cvrg-ext
Extension for generic CVRG portal projects

Loads in:
/opt/liferay/liferay-plugins-sdk-6.1.1/ext

IMPORTANT:  Before installing this Extension plugin you MUST edit the included portal-ext.properties file to provide a default admin e-mail address, username and password.  Otherwise the installation will fail to create a new default Admin account, even though it will still delete the default Liferay admin account.  This will leave the portal unuseable.
